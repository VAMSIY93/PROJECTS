The input testcases are in files:
input1.txt with 100 nodes and 10% edges(around 500)
input2.txt with 100 nodes and 40% edges (around 2000)
input3.txt with 200 nodes and 20% edges (around 4000)

The output for the input testcases are in files:
output1.txt 
output2.txt
output3.txt

The output files are sorted in ascending order of their weight.

The format of the the input/ output files :
	nodeid1,nodeid2:weight
where nodeid1 < nodeid2 and each egde is counted only once


The output of the implementation can be checked against the output provided using the
script provided. Command for comparing two files:
	make
